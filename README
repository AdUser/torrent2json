== Overview ==
  Set of programs to convert binary encoded torrent files to human readable
json and back.
  Acts as standart unix "filter" program: reads stdin, writes to stdout.

== Requirements ==
cmake - for building only, can be removed later
yajl - yet another json library (http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/)

== Compiling ==
$ cmake .
$ make
# make install

You may also do "out of tree" builds, like this:
$ mkdir .build && cd .build
$ cmake ..
$ make
# make install
... and all changes: new files, object modules, Makefile's, and so on will
be located in this dir.

== Authors ==
This utilites originally written by two peoples: michail and h4tr3d.
